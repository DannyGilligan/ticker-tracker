Ticker Tracker

Ticker-Tracker is an app that will allow the user to keep track of the stock trades that they open with the goal of helping the user reach their personal goal by recording their progress and providing insights into their performance.

The app is in a MVP state.

The home screen currently features a rudimentary dashboard where the user can view the relevant details for their trade:

Bugs Fixed:

I ran into a serious bug when deploying the project to Heroku and required the help of the Tutor team to resolve it. Holly and Jason were able to help immensely with the troubleshooting and guide me to a solution. In the end it turned out the env.py had been duplicated in during the import/build. As this issue used up all my Tutor hours to solve, I could not risk making any further changes to the app once it was working on Heroku!
